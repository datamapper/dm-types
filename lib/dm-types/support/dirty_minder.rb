# Approach
#
# We need to detect whether or not the underlying Hash or Array changed and
# update the dirty-ness of the encapsulating Resource accordingly (so that it
# will actually save).
#
# DM's state-tracking code only triggers dirty-ness by comparing the new value
# against the instance's Property's current value.  WRT mutation, we have to
# choose one of the following approaches:
#
#   (1) mutate a copy ("after"), then invoke the Resource assignment and State
#       tracking
#
#   (2) create a copy ("before"), mutate self ("after"), then invoke the
#       Resource assignment and State tracking
#
# (1) seemed simpler at first, but it required additional steps to alias the
# original (pre-hooked) methods before overriding them (so they could be invoked
# externally, ala self.clone.send("orig_...")), and more importantly it resulted
# in any external references keeping their old value (instead of getting the
# new), like so:
#
#   copy = instance.json
#   copy[:some] = :value
#   instance.json[:some] == :value
#    => true
#   copy[:some] == :value
#    => false  # fk!
#
# In order to do (2) and still have State tracking trigger normally, we need to
# ensure the Property has a different value other than self when the State
# tracking does the comparison.  This equates to setting the Property directly
# to the "before" value (a clone and thus a different object/value) before
# invoking the Resource Property/attribute assignment.
#
# The cloning of any value might sound expensive, but it's identical in cost to
# what you already had to do: assign a cloned copy in order to trigger
# dirty-ness (e.g. ::DataMapper::Property::Json):
#
#     model.json = model.json.merge({:some=>:value})
#
# Hooking Core Classes
#
# We want to hook certain methods on Hash and Array to trigger dirty-ness in the
# resource.  However, because these are core classes, they are individually
# mapped to C primitives and thus cannot be hooked through #send/#__send__.  We
# have to override each method, but we don't want to write a lot of code.
#
# Minimally Invasive
#
# We also want to extend behaviour of existing class instances instead of
# impersonating/delegating from a proxy class of our own, or overriding a global
# class behaviour.  This is the most flexible approach and least prone to error,
# since it leaves open the option for consumers to proxy or override global
# classes, and is less likely to interfere with method_missing/etc shenanigans.
#
# Nested Object Mutations
#
# Since we use {Array,Hash}#hash to compare before & after, and #hash accounts
# for/traverses nested structures, no "deep" inspection logic is technically
# necessary.  However, Resource#dirty? only queries a cache of dirtied
# attributes, whose own population strategy is to hook assignment (instead of
# interrogating properties on demand).  So the approach is still limited to
# top-level mutators.
#
# Maybe consider optional "advisory" Property#dirty? method for Resource#dirty?
# that custom properties could use for this purpose.
#
# TODO: add support for detecting mutations in nested objects, but we can't
#       catch the assignment from here (yet?).
# TODO: add support for block-based mutating methods
# TODO: ensure we got all the Hash mutation methods
# TODO: ensure we covered all indirectly-mutable classes that DM uses underneath
#       a property type
